## About

I live just outside of Boston, MA with my wife and two sons(I'm a step-dad aka faux pa). My main hobbies are futzing around outside, playing RPGs and hiking when I remember to. I've been in the Boston area for over 20 years now, before that I grew up in the woods of New Hampshire.

Currently I work at [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io) as a senior software engineer. Before that I've worked at places like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com) and [Mercy Corps](https://www.mercycorps.org). The main focus of my work has been adjacent to data, machine learning and Operations Research. I primarily use Python along with a dash of BASH. Well and SQL, who doesn't use SQL?
